****Project Summary****
I've built a basic project to demonstrate how to create a web application with a backend and frontend. This project manages product data using a RESTful API, built with Express.js for the backend and React for the frontend. MongoDB is used to store product information.

****Backend Development****
I used Express.js to create the backend API, which handles requests for managing products. I encountered some issues with CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) errors but solved them by setting up a proxy in the frontend.

****Frontend Development****
On the frontend, I used React and Axios to fetch data from the backend API. Tailwind CSS was used for styling, making it easy to create attractive product cards to display the data.

****Learning Experience****
This project was a valuable learning experience for me. I faced challenges such as CORS errors and debugging frontend-backend communication but was able to overcome them. Overall, I spent about 3 hours developing this project and gained practical experience in full-stack web development.
